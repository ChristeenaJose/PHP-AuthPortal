## **Setup**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Database and Tables**
   Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE LoginSystem;
   USE LoginSystem;
   ```
Then, use the database.sql file to set up the required tables.
### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Database**
Update the database credentials in the config.php file to connect the application to your database.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Session Management**
Session management for logged-in users is handled in the following files:
- **module/auth_session.php**
- **login.php**
- **active.php**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Create Registration and Login Forms**
- **login.php: The login form page.**
- **registration.php: The registration form page.**

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Double Opt-In Email Verification**
When a user registers, they will receive a double opt-in email to confirm their email address. This process requires them to click a verification link.

The email is sent using the PHP mail() function.
### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Page**
The dashboard.php page is where logged-in users can view their profile information.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Logout Functionality**
The logout.php file allows users to log out by destroying their session.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Forgot Password**
The system provides a "forgot password" feature where users can request a password reset.

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Magic Link for Login**
Users can log in using a magic link sent to their email. This eliminates the need for a traditional password.

### **üîü CSS Styles**
The application's styles are contained in the styles.css file.

## **Using Composer**
This project uses Composer to manage dependencies. Composer makes it easy to install libraries like PHPMailer and keep your project dependencies organized.

To handle the issue of the mail() function not working on macOS, you can use PHPMailer to send emails using an external SMTP server like Gmail SMTP instead of using PHP's built-in mail() function. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Composer
If you don't have Composer installed on your system, you can download and install it from the official website: https://getcomposer.org/download/.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Project Dependencies
To install all required dependencies (like PHPMailer), run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
composer install
This will install all the dependencies listed in the composer.json file, including PHPMailer.
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Autoloading
Composer automatically generates an autoloader, which you can use to load PHP classes. To use the autoloader in your project, include the following line at the beginning of your PHP files:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Add More Dependencies
You can easily add more PHP libraries or packages to your project using Composer. For example, to add PHPMailer or any other package, run:

```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
Composer will handle the installation and update your composer.json file with the new dependency.
```
